Google Chrome Extension - Minecraft Skin Viewer
==========================

A simple extension of http://skin.luke.sx available for Chrome Users.

I have decided to upload this project onto GitHub to grow my portfolio and to document my progress. As this project is done it will not have many updates because the work is complete. 
Feel free to fork and improve my work and have a great day.

Install the final release here:

##Release control
> V1.0 - Supports simple layout using skin.luke.sx However this will go offline on July 4th.

> V1.1 - Added a temporary fix because Google took my app offline due to images breaking.
